# raspberry pi pico-sdk project template

  This is a pico-sdk project template.
  
  Intended for use with VSCode.

  In my environment (Windows 11 x64), the kit "pico ARM GCC" cannot be recognized outside the example project, I installed the arm compiler from [https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads](https://developer.arm.com/downloads/-/arm-gnu-toolchain-downloads).
